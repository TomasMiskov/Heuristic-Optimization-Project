This is an implementation of several heuristic methods for solving the heterogeneous vehicle routing problem. In particular I solve the VFMP-F: **Vehicle Fleet Mix Problem with Fixed Costs**. All the details are in the report, the VFMP.ipynb is a Jupyter Notebook file that includes all the code.

There are instructions in there on how to test any of the functions mentioned in the report on a single instance. You can also re-run any of the experiments mentioned in the report.

To start, you need to run the first 4 cells that include
- import statements
- helper functions
- plotting functions
- main class that includes all the heuristic methods

After running these 4 cells, there is a 5th cell in which you can test any of the functions on a single instance. Just change the path to one of the files in the test_instnaces folder, and the plotted tours should appear.

The cells after include a cell that imports all the best known solutions, and then 1 cell per 1 experiment mentioned in the report.
